# 🚴 AdventureWorks Business Intelligence Project  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project demonstrates how **Power BI** can transform raw transactional data into **actionable business insights** for **AdventureWorks**, a global manufacturer of cycling equipment and accessories.  


Description:

This project is an end-to-end Power BI analysis using the AdventureWorks dataset. It covers data modeling, DAX calculations, and interactive dashboards that provide business insights on sales performance, customer segmentation, product analysis, and regional trends. The project demonstrates skills in data visualization, time intelligence, and storytelling through dashboards, making it a strong showcase of analytics and BI capabilities.


The management team needed to:  
🔹 Track **KPIs** (Sales, Revenue, Profit, Return Rate)  
🔹 Compare **regional and product performance**  
🔹 Analyze **customer behavior and product trends**  
🔹 Identify **high-value customers**  

To address these needs, I built **four interactive dashboards** with **dynamic visuals** and **page navigation**.
